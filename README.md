# Memscope Stress Test Suite

A high-performance Rust stress testing suite designed to thoroughly test the `memscope-rs` memory tracking library under extreme conditions. This project serves as both a demonstration of `memscope-rs` capabilities and a comprehensive pressure testing tool.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This stress test suite was created to:
- **Validate memscope-rs Performance**: Test the library's ability to handle massive memory tracking loads
- **Demonstrate Real-World Usage**: Show how memscope-rs performs with complex, realistic memory patterns
- **Benchmark Memory Tracking Overhead**: Measure the impact of memory tracking on application performance
- **Stress Test Edge Cases**: Push the library to its limits with extreme scenarios
- **Generate Comprehensive Reports**: Produce detailed SVG visualizations of memory usage patterns

## 🔬 How It Works

The stress test employs a sophisticated 8-phase testing methodology:

1. **Massive Data Structure Creation**: Generates thousands of vectors, strings, and nested collections
2. **Complex Memory Hierarchies**: Creates deeply nested structures with multiple levels of indirection
3. **Concurrent Memory Operations**: Spawns 100+ async tasks performing simultaneous memory operations
4. **Large-Scale Data Processing**: Processes millions of data points with parallel algorithms
5. **Memory Fragmentation Simulation**: Intentionally creates fragmented memory patterns
6. **Circular Reference Testing**: Tests complex Rc/Weak reference cycles
7. **Mixed Workload Simulation**: Simulates real-world application scenarios (database, cache, message queue)
8. **Memory Leak Detection**: Identifies potential memory leaks through controlled scenarios

Each phase tracks thousands of allocations using `memscope-rs`, generating comprehensive data for analysis.

## 🚀 8-Phase Stress Testing Features

Our comprehensive testing suite includes:

1. **Basic Data Structure Stress Test** - 1,000+ vectors, 50 string batches, 100 nested HashMaps
2. **Complex Nested Structure Test** - Deep hierarchies with BTreeMap + Arc + Mutex + VecDeque + Box
3. **Concurrent Memory Operations Test** - 100 async tasks with 5,000+ concurrent allocations
4. **Large Scale Data Processing Test** - 2M data points across 500 parallel batches
5. **Memory Fragmentation Test** - 100 fragmentation cycles with variable-sized chunks (10B-50KB)
6. **Circular Reference Stress Test** - 50 reference trees with 1,000 Rc/Weak nodes
7. **Mixed Workload Simulation** - Database (50K records), cache (200 entries), message queue (5K messages)
8. **Memory Leak Detection Test** - 100 iterations testing growing collections and temporary allocations
